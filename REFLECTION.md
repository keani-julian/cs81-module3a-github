## Reflection: Learning Experience Summary
In this assignment, I went throught the motions for how Git tracks changes and how GitHub hosts code. The most confusing part was remembering to stage files before committing and completing that whole process over and over again. I did go through trial and error and in the end, with enough accurate information and continuous familiarity of the syntax, I'm slowly understanding it. It's interesting how Git preserves history, allows collaboration, and makes recovering mistakes simple. I can see myself utilizing Git to help manage other and larger projects by keeping code organized and traceable.
